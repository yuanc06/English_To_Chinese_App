✅ Translation and background: In the subject matter of "激活函数" (Activation Functions), here are three specialized terminology and technical terms commonly used:
梯度消失问题 (Vanishing Gradient Problem): This term refers to the issue where the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the neural network become very small as they are propagated backward through the network layers. This can hinder the training of deep neural networks, especially when using certain activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent.
修正线性单元 (ReLU, Rectified Linear Unit): ReLU is a type of activation function commonly used in deep learning. It introduces non-linearity by returning the input if it's positive and zero otherwise. "修正" (Rectified) indicates the way it handles negative values.
饱和 (Saturation): This term is used to describe the behavior of an activation function when the input values are at extreme ends, causing the function to produce very small gradients. It's particularly relevant in the context of activation functions like the sigmoid and tanh when their outputs saturate (approach 0 or 1) for certain inputs.
These terms are essential when discussing and understanding activation functions in the context of neural networks and deep learning, especially in the context of their challenges and applications.
